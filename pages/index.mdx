# null0

Null0 is an easy & fun 2D game-engine that lets you write your game in many languages.

The basic idea is that you make your game in whatever language you like, and put that with your assets in a zip-file, and you can run it in libretro, or the standalone runtime.

We currently fully support these languages:

- Nim

These are planned:

- AssemblyScript
- C / C++
- C3
- D
- Go
- Nelua
- Odin
- Penne
- Porth
- Roland
- Rust
- WebAssembly Text
- Zig

You can use any language that compiles to wasm, so if you like something we are missing, consider making an idiomatic header/demo-project for your favorite language, and sending us a [PR](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0/pulls).

The plan is to have a complete template-project for any cart-language, so it's easy for people to get started with their preferred ecosystem.
