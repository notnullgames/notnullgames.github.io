## null0

<Callout emoji="🤣">
Null0 is an easy & fun 2D game-engine that lets you write your game in many languages. It's fun to use, and a great way to learn new programming languages.
</Callout>

The basic idea is that you make your game in whatever language you like, and put that with your assets in a zip-file, and you can run it in libretro, or the standalone runtime.


### supported

We currently fully support these languages:

- [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)

### planned

These are planned:

- AssemblyScript
- [C / C++](https://devdocs.io/c/)
- [C3](https://c3-lang.org/)
- [D](https://dlang.org/)
- [Go](https://tinygo.org/)
- [Lua](https://nelua.io/)
- [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/)
- [Roland](https://github.com/DenialAdams/roland)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [WebAssembly Text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format)
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)

### contribution

You can use any language that compiles to wasm, so if you like a language we are missing, consider making a language-idiomatic header/demo-project for your favorite language, and sending us a [PR](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0/pulls).
</Callout>

The plan is to have a complete template-project for any cart-language, so it's easy for people to get started with their preferred ecosystem.

#### notes:

- Try to use built-ins or sensible things for the language, for example, in nim we use `echo` in assemblyscript we use `trace`, and at some point C will use `printf`
- All resources (images, fonts, sounds, etc) are `8bit unsigned int` reference-counters, but feel free to wrap this however seems sensible for the language. Nim, for example, uses a overloaded `proc`s, so if you leave off the `destination` it assumes `0` (screen) and whenever you load something new, it will auto-increment the resource-counter, so the user doesn't have to manage it
- we can add things to the host, if the language just cannot do soemthing, but you should try to do everything in the cart-header to adapt the language to it's host. For example, assemblyscript uses WTF16 encoding for strings, so we translate those to/from UTF8 null-terminated ("C strings") before interacting with the host.
