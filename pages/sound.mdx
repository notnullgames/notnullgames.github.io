Our docs aren't really ready, but we're working on it.

Here is the nim signatures for now:

```nim
# sound-source: load a sound file (ogg, wav, etc) from file inside the cart
proc load_sound(destination: uint8, filename: cstring)

# sound-source: create a text-to-speech talker
proc load_speech(destination: uint8, text: cstring)

# play a sound-source
proc play_sound(id: uint8)
```
