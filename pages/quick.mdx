It's really easy to get started with null0. You can use our CLI tool to quickly jump in. 

- First, download [the CLI tool](#linkneeded)
- put it somewhere in your path
- run `null0 init` to create a new project

It will ask you a few questions, and you pick a language to start with.

You can run your game in the [standalone runtime](#linkneeded) or inside [libretro](#linkneeded). Eventually, we will have it setup so you can install it through the Retroarch UI, but for now:

- Download the libretro core for your platform [here](https://github.com/notnullgames/null0/releases) you can also grab some prebuilt .null0 carts to test things.
- Drop the so/dylib/dll in your [libretro core directory](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/change-directories/)
- Run [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/), and navigate to your .nulll0 cart, and run it
